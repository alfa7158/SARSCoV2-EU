#	Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.

This project was started as result of the fact that I enjoy reading and learning about public health
as well as the fact that it is related to what I have studied in the university. 
These realities led me think about creating an app that holds everything 
that is related to covid-19 specially with the fact of how the virus is 
spreading around the world.Besides how the project was started, in creating this
project, I tookmultiple steps. These steps are deigning the app on figma before
implementing anything in the android studio, writing lists of features 
that will be included, finding an api that will cover the feature 
expected as well as making sure that all requirement are met with the app
features and finally started writing the app. Through these steps, I depended on
the organization of the code to catch error as well as creating a recycler view for each model 
instead of binding class which help me in finding the errors easily. In addition to that, 
I kept testing every functionality after writing it to make sure that I do not face future issues.


# List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.

Drawing chart is one of the unsolved problems as it was in the original plan of the app, 
however, due to an issue with jetback graphing libraires, the graphing feature will be
held for future improvement of the app. 

# Features
The app is desgined to keep people up to date with anything that is covid ralted including:
1- seeing news that are covid realted
2- seeing updates about world population and how it is affect by covid-19 and public health related
3 - seeing update about treatment and vaccine around the world 
4- post photos, audio, videos that covid ralted or express  feelings of the user
5- report cases of covid to public health administrators
6 - take a survey to determain if your symptoms are covid-related or not  
7- add user profile
# Describe how some of your favorite functions work

World update is my favorite part that I worked on for in the app due 
to the fact that number of covid cases are increasing every day
# Future feature:
1- improving design 
2- using expo-player for the audio
3- adding likes and comments as soon as the design is improved for best user experince
4- adding the number of daily cases and deaths in each country whihch is almost done.
5- finishing up the features of pdf  and documents
